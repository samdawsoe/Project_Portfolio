# Project_Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. Here I want to share some projects demonstrating Python functionalities.

I will continously adding more projects.


## Spotify global charts analysis

Spotify is one of the worlds largest streaming platforms for audio content. 

I used a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts) which includes chart positions and streaming amounts for 70 different countries between Jan 1st 2017 and December 31st 2021.

Purpose of this notebook is to provide some intereseting insights hence I analyzed the data regarding overall trends, artists and songs.

Please find the analysis [here](./Spotify%20Global%20Charts%20Analysis/spotify_analysis.ipynb)


## iPhone prices web scraping

[asgoodasnew](https://asgoodasnew.de/) is one of th largest online shops in Germany for refurbished electronics. They offer 4 different condition types.

The intention of this project is to collect the price development of iPhone 14. Therefore I scraped price information for all different variations of iPhone 14 (memory size and color) Additionally you will information regarding the availability and discounts.
